Two examples of closures:

In the Revealing Module pattern, the function returns an object that allows
variables and functions that are internally scoped to exist outside the
scoping function:

var someModule = function() {
     var privateVar = 39;
     var publicVar = 'jim';
     var publicMethod = function() {
        console.log(privateVar);
     };

     return {
        myName : publicVar,
        sayAge : publicMethod
     };
};

Instantiating someModule with the new keyword would give that new object
access to the variables that are exposed through the return statement.
