Some concise notes from http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing:

- Events first are captured down to deepest target, then bubble up. In IE<9 they only bubble.
- All handlers work on bubbling stage excepts addEventListener with last argument true, which is the only way to catch the event on capturing stage.
- Bubbling/capturing can be stopped by event.cancelBubble=true (IE) or event.stopPropagation() for other browsers.


- Only bubbling is supported by major browsers.

Also:

event.target is the element at which the event originated. In IE, it's event.srcElement.
