js-algorithms-data-structures
=============================

Using javascript to implement data structures, algorithms, and common interview
problems. This is for those who are front-end engineers who don't have comp sci
degrees, but may be applying for a front-end position where the interviewer
expects this knowledge.

I've been following Cracking the Coding Interview and Data Structures and
Algorithms in Javascript for this preparation. CCI solutions are implemented
in Java, so I have tackled them in javascript and then made revisions of the
solution in javascript. DSAJ data structures and tests are taken from the book
but I have commented (and corrected mistakes!) on the code to ensure I am
understanding each line thoroughly.

Notes:
======

Some other problems to try:

- Write a function that takes two sorted lists of numbers and merges them into a single sorted list.
- Given an array of integers (positive or negative) find the sub-array with the largest sum.
- Determine if a given string is a palindrome.
- Given a large hash table whose keys are movie names and whose values are a list of actors in those movies, write a function to determine the Bacon number of a particular actor.
- Given two nodes in a binary search tree, find the lowest common ancestor of the two nodes.
- Design the data structures and algorithms to detect typos in a document and then provide suggestions to the user.

Talking through questions:

- Generally, what problem in OO development do design patterns solve? What's your favorite design pattern, and why?
- How does a binary tree work?
